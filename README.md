https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt


# How to use

This frontend is made to work with the MAME emulator. 
For Linux systems: 
mame must be instaled in the typical bin folders of your system. This frontend also requires ps1 memory card files located at ~/.mame/memcard(/psx.mc1 and /psx.mc2) for the Playstation launcher.


For Windows systems:
Place these files in the same folder as your mame executable with the rest of mame's folders. This frontend also requires ps1 memory card files located at memcard(/psx.mc1 and /psx.mc2) for the Playstation launcher.



Also bios files for each system are required and must be placed where your MAME instalation rom path.
